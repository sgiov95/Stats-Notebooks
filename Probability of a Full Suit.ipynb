    "This is within the confidence interval. The main thing that would conceivably make the case where we do have replacement more analytically tractable is that since the bin counts for each suit upon each simulation of 7 cards, without replacement, then the probability for each suit is the same for each draw, at $\\frac{1}{4}$. However, one still needs to figure out the number of Permutations for each possible arangement in the bincounts for each suit. For example, for (4,1,1,1), this defines all sets of 7 cards drawn from the deck, and in both the case where there is replacement and where there isn't. you have this being one out of three possible bincounts that are in descending order. For example, 4 cards from Hearts, and 1 card each from Spades, Clubs and Diamonds, and then the case where 4 cards are Diamonds and each of the other suits has 1 card each, both are classified as (4,1,1,1). So then for the number of such 4-tuples given 7 cards drawn, you would have to figure out both the number of and the 4-tuple combinations themselves that satisfy this criteria (for 7 cards, it would be 3, as previously discussed) and for each of these 4-tuples, one would also need the number of ways that four distinct suits would be arrangeable into this particular 4-tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when 7 cards are drawn from a deck of 52 cards, 13 in each suit, Diamonds (D), Clubs (C), Hearts (H), and Spades (S), if you have to find the number of possible ways to get (4,1,1,1), you could list out all of the possible 4-tuples for (C,D,H,S):\n",

    "4. (1 C,1 D,1 H,4 S)\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are a total of four different ways here. In general, depending on the bin count of the 4-tuple itself, we can figure out this combination for each thing. So for example:\n",

    "1. (4,1,1,1) has 1 4 and 3 1s, so there are $\\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}$ = $4$ ways to get this, which is a permutation\n",
